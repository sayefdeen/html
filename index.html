          <span>the</span> COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus
          pandemic, is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019
          (COVID‑19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
          (SARS‑CoV‑2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, China, in
          December 2019. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a
          Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020,
          and a pandemic on 11 March. As of 22 June 2020, more than 8.91 million
          cases of COVID-19 have been reported in more than 188 countries and
          territories, resulting in more than 466,000 deaths; more than 4.4
          million people have recovered.

          <span> virus</span> is primarily spread between people during close
          contact,[c] most often via small droplets produced by coughing,[d]
          sneezing, and talking. The droplets usually fall to the ground or onto
          surfaces rather than travelling through air over long distances.
          However, research as of June 2020 has shown that speech-generated
          droplets may remain airborne for tens of minutes. Less commonly,
          people may become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then
          touching their face. It is most contagious during the first three days
          after the onset of symptoms, although spread is possible before
          symptoms appear, and from people who do not show symptoms.
