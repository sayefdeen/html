          The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an
          ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19), caused
          by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2). The
          outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The
          World Health Organization declared the outbreak a Public Health
          Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, and a pandemic
          on 11 March. As of 22 June 2020, more than 8.91 million cases of
          COVID-19 have been reported in more than 188 countries and
          territories, resulting in more than 466,000 deaths; more than 4.4
          million people have recovered.

          The virus is primarily spread between people during close contact,[c]
          most often via small droplets produced by coughing,[d] sneezing, and
          talking. The droplets usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces
          rather than travelling through air over long distances. However,
          research as of June 2020 has shown that speech-generated droplets may
          remain airborne for tens of minutes. Less commonly, people may become
          infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their
          face. It is most contagious during the first three days after the
          onset of symptoms, although spread is possible before symptoms appear,
          and from people who do not show symptoms.
